# MIS-Graduate-Admission-Data-Mining
This is a data mining project I completed for the Data Mining course at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics
Abstract: Under the pressure of employment and the surge in the number of applicants for Graduate Entrance Examination(Kaoyan), as well as more and more families entering the middle class, an increasing number of undergraduates are eager to go abroad for postgraduate study, but choosing a school is a problem that must be faced by applicants. In this paper, machine learning models are constructed to help applicants predict whether they will be admitted to their dream schools by using the admission dataset of graduate students from the Management Information System of the United States, so as to better optimize the school selection list. In the model construction, this paper discusses a variety of basic models and constructs the ensemble model to enhance the result, and finally selects the model with the best performance in the validation set for super-parameter tuning, thus optimizing the model. In addition to modeling, this paper first cleaned the data and carried out Exploratory Data Analysis, random forest factor importance analysis and principal component analysis on the cleaned data.
